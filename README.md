# 8.04 Notes

These are my notes for Quantum Mechanics I (8.04) at MIT during Spring 2019.
I cannot guarantee the accuracy of these notes, because they were
quickly typed up (mostly) during the lecture with minimal proofreading.
I take responsibility for all errors found in the document.
Pull requests for typos/mistakes welcome!
